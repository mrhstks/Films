  <p> When I was around 10 years old I wrote my very first story.<br> 70 pages of free handed creativity dedicated to what it would <br> be like for two children to travel back in time and meet The Jackson Five.<br> Ever since the conception of that story but love for movies and television <br> shows escalated. At 25 years I finally almost finished completing my<br>Bachelors in Film! Its taken me a long 7 years to come to the end of this degree<br> but I am so happy that I am final here! During my 7 years of technical and<br> life experiencing training, I have encountered many movies that have completely<br>changed my brain chemistry, lol. These films are just a few of the many pieces of<br>cinematic artworks that have made a huge impact on me. <br>Lets dive in and see HOW they've made their impact on me.</p>
