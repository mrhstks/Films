<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pjy5MK1X70">Into the Woods</a>, a theatrical musical turned film, was released in 2014 starring big names<br>like <em>Anna Kendrick, James Gorden, Emily Blunt, and Meryl Streep.</em> This movie took the<br>musical world by storm. Everything about this movie made me fall in love with musicals all over again<br>This movie is a colorfully fun adaption of some of our most common fairytales with an emphasizes<br> on the weakness of humanity. Stories such as<em>Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, and Cinderella,<br></em> all show up in this film. The creators of this piece of artwork perfectly combined important<br>concepts while keeping the attitude of the film playful and open-hearted. I remember singing<br>the songs from this movie in High School. Its impact on me will never be forgotten.</p>
