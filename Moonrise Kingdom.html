  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N8wkVA4_8s"> Moonrise Kingdom </a>, released in 2012, is a quirky coming-of-age story about<br>two kids who fall madly in love and run away from home.<br>Shortly after their disappearance a catastrophic storm approaches the island<br>and the adults must find them before dangers strikes.<br>This offbeat, deadpan film, directed by Wes Anderson, was one of the<br>first films I studied and wrote about. The color, the camera movements,<br>the simple yet profound dialogue all made this movie stand out as something that<br>many filmmakers still study to this day. I believe that the first time I saw this film, I was actually<br>still a teenager. The impact it had on me as a child was completely different from the impact<br>it had on rastically impacted how I viewed the boundaries of filmmaking.</p>
