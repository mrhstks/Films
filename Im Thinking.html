<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knmORK9kAzA">Im Thinking of Ending Things,</a> released in 2020, is an offbeat, cerebral<br>exploration of the roles that fantasies play in our everyday lives<br>especially for those who struggle with mental health issues.<br>A young decides that it's time to take his girlfriend to visit his family<br>farm and meet his parents. Throughout their journey, they encounter<br>a series of strange events including: one of the main characters's name<br>changing throughout the film, timelines being distorted, and outfits suddenly changing<br>the whole movie takes place in one night but makes you feel as if you have witnessed<br>many lifetimes. I've seen so many movies but the beautiful way that this movie was crafted<br>impacted me on a different level. The color pallete, the poetic dialogue, and the stunning<br>use of sound. Surprisingly, this is one movie that I can watch over and over again.</p>
