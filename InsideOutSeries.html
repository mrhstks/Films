  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyNu2GuHPAg">The Inside Out Series</a> released its debut film in 2015. This hidden gem, absolutely changed<br>my life and touched a part of my being that had been left untapped for a long time.<br> The first film follows eleven year old Riley as she navigates moving to a new city and all<br>the uncertainties that come with it. Her main emotions: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, and Fear,<br> control her everyday movements and moments as she navigates the world around her.<br>The second film caught up with Riley again when she turned 13 years old. We saw her dealing with new emotions<br>as she navigated the complex nature of being a teenager. This film series has absolutely changed my life.<br> I could watch these movies over and over again and cry every single time. It's no longer just a<br>movie, it's a therapy session. This groundbreaking cartoon was able to simplify a majority of complex emotions<br>in a way little kids could understand. Disney and Pixar didn't just create a movie, they created a movement.</p>
